GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
 have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
 or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

 For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.

 Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

 For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.

 Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

 Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

  “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
 “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

  To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
 earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

  A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.

  To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.

  To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source
 form of a work.

  A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces
 specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely
 used among developers working in that language.

  The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
 regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 this License.  The terms “make available” and “otherwise make
 accessible” are used reciprocally here.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or limiting circumvention of such measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing technological
 measures, whether lawful or not.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License applies to the
 code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give
 all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    require that recipients receive a copy of this License along with
    the Program.

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
    to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
    therefore apply to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
  sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
  on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

  You must convey the Corresponding Source in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
    used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years, to give anyone
    the Corresponding Source for no charge, on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative
    is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
    received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
    subsection b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a fee), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the network
    server at no charge.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source
    of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge
    under subsection d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  included in conveying the object code work.

  A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product” used
  predominantly for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) any
  other product used for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining
  whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
  resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by
  a particular user, “predominantly used” means a principal use of the
  product other than commercial, industrial or business use.

  Conveying under this section 6 is governed by the terms of
  “Installation Information” in section 6:

    0) The requirement to provide installation information does not
    apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
    install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the
    work is installed in ROM).

    1) You must provide to the recipient of a User Product the
    Installation Information that is required to install and execute
    modified object code version on the User Product.  The information
    must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the User
    Product
    is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.

    2) Installation Information must include any methods, procedures,
    authorization keys, or other information required to install and
    execute modified object code version on the User Product from a
    modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    ensure that the recipient can install modified object code on the
    User Product if it has the ability to do so.

    3) The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
    include a requirement to provide any trade secrets, passwords, or
    cryptographic keys that are used to secure a User Product
    (for example, digital rights management keys).

  The correspondence to the installation information required under
  subsection 6 is that it will suffice to ensure that the continued
  functioning of the User Product will not be prevented or interfered
  with solely because modification has been made.  If you convey a
  User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction
  transferring the possession and ownership of the product to a user,
  the requirements of subsections 6 also apply to the "party
  transferring possession and ownership" of the User Product who
  would be responsible for providing installation information.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
  in accord with this section 6, must be in a format that is publicly
  documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
  source code form), and must require no special password or key for
  unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the
  extent that they are valid under applicable law.  Additional
  permissions may be written to require their own conditions, or may
  be otherwise conditional or unconditional.  For example, conditions
  might specify that material from a certain publisher requires
  preservation of the publisher's copyright notices in all copies of
  the work.

  Not all conditions or restrictions of this License will apply to all
  parts of the Program.  For example, this License does not revoke
  permissions granted for material published under terms of some other
  license.

  You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public
  License along with this License.  If not, see
  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) on the condition that you
  notify the copyright holder of the violation by some reasonable
  means prior to termination.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder fails to notify you
  of the violation by some reasonable means before 60 days after the
  cessation.

  Furthermore, this license does not grant you any rights to use any
  trademark or trade name of the copyright holder, except as expressly
  provided in this License.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.

  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
  propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions are prohibited
  by law if you do not accept this License.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors to run, modify and
  propagate that work subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  11. Patents.

  A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributions”.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
  patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
  make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
  propagate the contents of its contribution.

  In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
  agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
  (such as a promise not to sue)   made by one or more contributors to
  the Program.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
  and the conveyance is not excluded from patent licensing, the patent
  license is automatically reinstated unless explicitly revoked.

  Patents held by contributors to the Program are available to
  everyone under the terms of this License.

  However, some patent licenses are not available under this License.

  For example, if you institute patent litigation against any
  contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by   the Program,
  your patent license from such contributor   is terminated
  automatically.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
  not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
  this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
  you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program
  by all those who receive copies directly from you, then the only way
  you could satisfy both it and this License is to refrain entirely from
  distribution.

  If you distribution rights are terminated under this License, they
  are reinstated if the copyright holder   issues a written statement
  granting you permission to do so.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
  combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
  License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
  but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
  section 13, concerning interaction through a network   will apply to
  the combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
  of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
  detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
  it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the
  terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
  published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
  specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
  ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If you want to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
  author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
  the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
  we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by
  the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
  generally.

                       NO WARRANTY

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY
  OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
  THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
  PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
  EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO
  YOU.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES
  ARISING FROM YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING ANY
  GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED
  OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
  terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and any file that uses the program
  should contain at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where
  the full license is found.

      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

      This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
      the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
      (at your option) any later version.

      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
      GNU General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
      along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
